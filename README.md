# README

You want to change the world. You want to solve a problem.
You want to use your tech skills to empower people to do good things.
There should be an app for that--except somehow there isn't.
So you're gonna find some friends, pitch your idea, and build something.

But you want them to start running straight away. 
So it needs to be open, so they can clone the repo without permissions.
And containerized, so they can run the thing without too much faff.
Then once you've built  it, it needs to be able to run forever, for free.
